To start kafka first we need to start zookeeper , java need to be installed on system
command to start zookeeper:

bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

or depends on where we are currently on cli

./zookeeper-server-start.sh ../config/zookeeper.properties

open config/zookeeper.properties file, you should see the clientPort property set to 2181, which is the port that your Zookeeper server is currently 
listening.

# the port at which the clients will connect
clientPort=2181

Topic create on mac 

./kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 4

produce message to topic

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9093,localhost:9094,localhost:9095 --topic test-topic

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic

List topic 
./kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092


./kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic my-kafka-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092


Starting the Kafka Brokers cluster

However, there are three properties that have to be unique for each broker instance:

File: kafka_2.13-3.0.0/config/server.properties

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id=0

# The address the socket server listens on. It will get the value returned from 
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092

# A comma separated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs
